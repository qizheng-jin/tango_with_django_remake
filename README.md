# tango_with_django_remake
I failed to commit the code in github, this is a reforged django program.
I have finished the first 10 chapters exercises in <Tango with Django> in last three weeks, however, I did not use git command to
commit my codes. Inside, I directly upload my files in gitHub website. Then I found all my changes are not updated in Github, I emailed
Mr Camarasa and he told me I have to do it all over again. So I restarted again and create this repository. So this is my second time do
those exercises. I hope this could explain why I finished all the exercise in three days.
